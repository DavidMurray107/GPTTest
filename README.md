This is a testing solution for integrating ChatGPT functionality.

I am leveraging the community library from betalgo found here https://github.com/betalgo/openai
In order to use this you need to add the following object to your secrets. 
```
 "OpenAIServiceOptions": {
    //"ApiKey":"Your API Key goes here"
    //,"Organization": "Your Organization Id goes here (optional)"
  }
```
